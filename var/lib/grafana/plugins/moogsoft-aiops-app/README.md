## Supported version

This Grafana app is only supported from Moogsoft AIOps 7.0 onwards.

## Template variables

To setup templating specify the endpoint name in the query field (of the query variable).

Example: `getTeams` orÂ `getServices`.

In the select dropdowns in the query editor specify the name of the variable with `$` prefix. For example if a variable is named `Team`, specify `$Team` in the teams dropdown, then hit enter key to add the variable. You can now set team filter by using the variable dropdown at the top of the dashboard.
